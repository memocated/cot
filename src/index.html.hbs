intro:
  Hi!<br/>
  We are <strong>Memocate,</strong><br/>
  and we are creating the<br/>
  <strong>aid for dementia.</strong>
stories:
 - h1: A Dream of Human Encounters
   p_1: During her studies our co-founder, Camilla Lindholm, worked in a local nursing home where she found that her interaction skills with the residents took center stage. Life with them was rewarding, but a feeling of inadequacy began to surface. She wondered how she could avoid time-consuming misunderstandings. And how to effectively interact with residents whose vocabulary was limited.
   p_2: These challenges of care work led to long-term research on memory diseases and interaction at the University of Helsinki. The research was inspired by a strong desire to help and to have a positive societal impact, and Memocate was born to convey the fruits of these studies to all who live and work with these types of issues on a daily basis.

 - h1: We Are <br>Memocate
   p_1: Over the years, the dream of one person has grown to a goal shared by our whole team. We want to improve our customers' lives by facilitating positive interactions. Our company was born at the University of Helsinki in order to offer new kinds of digital training materials to support the treatment of patients with memory-related ailments.
   p_2: Our online training platform provides operational models for challenging interaction situations in care as well as giving you the opportunity to process the  emotional difficulties that often come with the work. Memory diseases cannot yet be cured, but with effective interaction, we can increase the wellbeing of people suffering from dementia, ease the burden related to care work and bring relief to our customers' lives.

 - h1: A Special Product,<br> a Special Team
   p_1: Our operations are founded upon a strong scientific background. We want to help people by adding knowledge and understanding. In addition to our scientific advisor, Camilla, our energetic team has extensive expertise in training design coding.
   p_2: The key to our work is professionalism, communication and innovation. These shared values are guided and developed by our daily activities.

 - h1: Our Future
   p_1: What makes us special and allows us to produce high-quality training materials is our strong background in science. We will continue to develop and utilise the latest research data going forward. Our service is developed in cooperation with our customers based on continuous feedback received from them. Our customers' experiences are the starting point for our work.
   p_2: The first step is to establish our business and our position in Finland. After five years, we see ourselves operating and educating caregivers in other European countries as well. We will nspire and create new solutions to challenging care and interaction situations and we will not stop there. Our story is just beginning.

service:
  p_1: We are preparing a new kind of web education service for both professional and non-professional caregivers of people with memory diseases as well as students in the health sector.
  p_2: We work in close collaboration with our customers in order to increase our understanding of memory disease and to improve the interaction between people with memory diseases and their caregivers. We also offer contact teaching and consulting according to the needs of our customers.
  p_3: We are currently launching the first version of our service. We are looking for partners in our product’s development and to support international expansion.

research:
  p_1: >
    <p>A person with dementia can't always express their feelings and thoughts verbally. The lack of means of expression may become manifest as challenging behaviour.</p>
    <p>In the simplest case, a person with dementia doesn't, for instance, notice that they are being addressed if their caregiver doesn't stop right in front of them. This can lead to misunderstandings and frustration. Proper communication with a person with dementia is a proven way of non-pharmacological rehabilitation method that minimises problematic behaviour and makes life easier for people with memory diseases and those who interact with them.</p>
  p_2: >
    <p>Memocate is based on research conducted at the University of Helsinki. Since 2005, Camilla Lindholm has researched the interaction between people with memory diseases and their caregivers. In her research, she focuses on the strategies that caregivers and people with memory diseases use in their interaction and how the interaction works when one of the parties can't participate on an equal basis because of a memory disorder. When words disappear and language is harder to understand, the responsibility of keeping the conversation going is transferred to the healthy party. Camilla uses videotaped research material and conversation analysis to bring out details that have previously remained hidden.</p>
